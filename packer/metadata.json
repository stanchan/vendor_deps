  "long_description": "# packer cookbook\n\nInstalls [Packer](http://packer.io/) using the [ark](https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/ark) cookbook.\n\n# Requirements\n\nNone.\n\n# Usage\n\nJust include `recipe[packer]` in your run list.\n\nThis will put Packer into `/usr/local` in a `packer-*version*` directory, with a symlink of `packer` to `/usr/local/bin`.\n\n# Attributes\n\n* `node[:packer][:url_base]` - Base URL from which to download (in case you have your own mirror). Defaults to the link at http://www.packer.io/downloads.html.\n* `node[:packer][:version]` - The version of Packer to install.\n* `node[:packer][:arch]` - Architecture to use; auto-detects amd64 and 386 but you must override with arm if desired.\n* `node[:packer][:raw_checksums]` - The contents of the upstream checksum file to allow checksum auto-detection.\n* `node[:packer][:checksums]` - A `Hash` mapping file name to checksums, derived by default from `raw_checksums`.\n* `node[:packer][:checksum]` - SHA-256 checksum of appropriate binary. Should be auto-detected for the default version using data in `raw_checksums` or `checksums`.\n\nWhen overriding with a particular desired version, you can set the checksum a variety of ways. When\nthis cookbook is updated for a new default version, the checksums will be updated by the maintainers.\n\nIf you require a particular older (or newer) version, you can update the\n`raw_checksums` with the official SHA256SUM list from\n`https://dl.bintray.com/mitchellh/packer/${VERSION}_SHA256SUMS?direct`\n(easiest), directly override the `checksums` attribute with an explicit map of\njust the versions you want (somewhat more work for you), or just directly\nsetting the `checksum` attribute (if you only need a single platform).\n\nNote that you can also ignore the checksum variables if you don't care about downloading\nthe binary repeatedly as [Chef only uses the checksum to avoid re-downloads][remote_file], and not\nto verify integrity.\n\n[remote_file]: http://docs.opscode.com/resource_remote_file.html#file-re-downloads\n\n# Author\n\nAuthor:: Emil Sit (<sit@hadapt.com>)\n",
